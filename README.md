A fast-paced boxing training game where timing and reflexes are everything!

## 🎮 How to Play

**Objective**: Follow the on-screen cues and press the correct keys at the right time to build your score and streak.

**Controls**:
- **J** - Jab
- **K** - Cross  
- **L** - Hook
- **I** - Uppercut
- **Space** - Block
- **R** - Restart (when game is over)

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

- **Watch the cue text** - It will tell you which key to press
- **Time your hits perfectly** for maximum points:
  - Perfect timing = 100 points
  - Good timing = 50 points  
  - Late timing = 10 points
- **Build streaks** for bonus sounds and speed increases
- **Wrong keys cost lives** - Press any key other than the cue and lose a heart
- **5 hearts total** - Game over when you lose them all
- **90-second rounds** - Survive as long as possible!

## 🏆 Scoring System

- **Perfect hits** keep your streak alive and earn maximum points
